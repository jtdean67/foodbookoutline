## Part I: Conceptual foundation

# 1. The Manhattan Problem and the Ratatouille effect

### Manhattan considered to have the "best" food in the world

Largely agreed that it has probably the widest variety of food from different cultures around the world. But is (any of) it really good?

### Everyone thinks "ethnic" food of other cultures is great, but own cuisine never quite right.

Nothing is considered authentic by the people who should know

+ The French love the Japanese food   
+ The Japanese love the Italian food
+ The Italians love the Chinese food
+ The Chinese love the French food

### Authenticity is replication

#### People want an identical culinary experience to what they remember eating in the old country

Pixar's _Ratatouille_, when the harsh reviewer is taken back to his childhood by a single dish

#### Things are considered "not right" if they deviate from that memory

Slight changes in flavor, texture, taste lead to judgment as "close but not quite there"

# 2. Transplanted cuisine: an example from Chinese food

### Most important transplanted cuisine today

Chinese diaspora fastest growing immigrant group in America, wealthier and more educated than average 

Half the world's population lives within a 4-hour flight of Hong Kong

### Food brought by people who immigrated from China

China is a country of 1.3 billion people, so it makes as much sense to talk of 
"Chinese" cuisine as it does of "white people" food. 

Heavy bias in particular regional cuisine, corresponding to waves of immigration

Chinatowns started by immigrants from Canton, later waves from different provinces

### Adaptation to local tastes for commercial reasons, in a restaurant setting

+ Cashew Chicken, Kansas City, 1970s

+ Ristorante Cinese, with traditional Italian serving structure of noodles first, then meat, with no parallels in actual Chinese cuisine

+ Reverse adaptation: Kentucky fried chicken tastes different in America vs in China

### Current state of Chinese food in America misses the broader context worldwide

#### Low cost trap limits quality

+ Not possible to have a fine-dining experience. 

+ No appetite for expensive Chinese food

+ Only acceptable fancy Asian food is Japanese ($400+ sushi in NYC). Why?

### Generalized problems are faced by other major cultures around the world

+ India also a very populous, large country with wealth

+ Next in population are Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh

+ Half of the world's population can't get a fancy meal based on their own food, in the West

# 3. Drawbacks of Replication

### Physically impossible?

Different ingredients

Different climate

### Requires intercontinental transport

+ Unsound from an environmental perspective
+ Expensive
+ Quality and freshness always suffer

### Precludes innovation

Same, boring, lowest-common denominator, demand-driven ethnic food

"I feel like sushi today", etc. Focuses on the "what" of food, not its quality

### Canon of particular dishes

Little exposure given to parts of China with few immigrants here.

Muslims in the northwest: lamb dishes

Manchuria

Ethnic minorities (hundreds of millions of people)

#### No recognition of influences Chinese culture has had on other foods

Ketchup is Cantonese fish sauce from the 19th century. Ke = tomato; Jep = sauce.


# 4. Local, sustainable sourcing: example from New England

### Most important current food trend

Unifies environmental protection and highest quality  

Local does not imply sustainable, but we want both

Demand driven: by using best ingredients, get best taste in food

#### Environmental sustainability

Managing resources in a way that preserves current and future food supply

Example of fisheries in the Gulf of Maine: cooperation between states, feds, Canada

#### Freshest ingredients

Highest quality, particularly seafood

Fish and shellfish from the ocean served same day at restaurants

#### Reduction of transport costs

Economic cost

Environmental damage

Complexities of global warming argument: half-filled pickup truck driving to farmer's market is worse than a large train or ship

### What is local?

Gulf of Maine seafood, unified management with other states and Canada

Radius of a couple of hundred km for land-based farms

### When is local important and desirable?

Minimize negative environmental impact

But the local environment can't supply everything, and we have good transport infrastructure

#### Perishable ingredients

Anything that requires air transport to maintain freshness is bad for the environment, expensive, etc.

#### Things that can be shipped slowly are fine

No penalty for sending dried rice on a ship from Thailand, when it takes weeks and incurs negligible environmental impact

Dried spices, etc. 

No worse than getting a computer shipped from China

Arguably better than trying to grow rice in a place in the wrong climate, too little water, etc.


# 5. Authentic, locally-sourced transplanted cuisine: application to Cantonese

### Ethnic food and identity politics

I can only talk about Chinese food without incurring the wrath of the PC police

Notions of cultural hegemony, misappropriation, 

### Focus on Cantonese cuisine

Generally regarded as the most food-centric part of China

Climate and environment give largest access to widest variety of ingredients

Economic priority to focus on food

My mother is from Hong Kong

"If the back faces the sky, man has an obligation to eat it"

"We eat everything with four legs but the table"

### Conceptual foundations of Cantonese cuisine

+ Take the best ingredients, do the least damage 

+ Rice as main carbohydrate (not wheat, noodles, etc.)

+ Trinity of flavoring: ginger, garlic, scallions

### Beyond replication: innovation with science and technology

Understanding traditional cooking methods, extracting the physics of the process

Apply to locally-sourced ingredients in a manner compatible with the flavor profile

Result certainly better than replication or what is available in America

May inform the original, and provide ways to improve the food back home

Win-win: no compromises in terms of environmental sustainability or quality

No free lunch, though: may require more expense, time, or other costs

### Not (cold) fusion

Not suggesting a grab-bag of techniques and flavors to create something unrecognizable

Not at all "fusion", or trying to make a Cantonese-inspired burger or pizza

Want food that is recognizably Cantonese, even if made with local ingredients

1. Stir friend lobster with ginger and garlic. Homarus Americanus does not exist in the Pacific
Yet all Cantonese would recognize it as a very traditional preparation, just with a slightly different organism.

2. Dungeness Crab: price in British Columbia is hugely jacked up because most of the catch goes to Asia

## Part II: Worked examples

# 6. Implementating Cantonese cuisine in the New England ecosystem

Not simply recipes to be followed, but telling the story of the dishes from start to finish

### Each dish class description / chapter includes:

1. An important main ingredient that has an interesting aspect in New England

+ Unique, local connection, based on new technology or techniques to protect the environment and increase flavor and taste

+ The complete story, start to finish, of how that ingredient starts in the ocean, field, etc. and gets to the kitchen, and the people involved

2. A novel technique to further bring out its natural flavor

+ Complete description of the interesting or non-obvious scientific principles behind new techniques, and how they improve upon traditional methods

+ where relevant, an explanation of new apparatus or equipment needed


# 7. Sous-vide shellfish appetizer with ginger and scallions

### Ingredient 1: Diver scallop, wild

Sustainably harvested by hand, and taken alive. Processed that day, so that large scallops retain sweetness

New England's scallop fishery is one of its most profitable, and is sustainable; vs. dredging, bay scallops,
nitrates to increase weight, fake skate wing cutouts.

### Ingredient 2: White shrimp, aquaculture

Sky8 Shrimp Farm, Stoughton, MA
Indoor, land-based shrimp farm (miles from the ocean); completely sustainable and friendly for the environment (recirculating water)
Year-round availability, no antibiotics or hormones as in many sian shrimp farms 

### Technique: Sous vide

Scallops / shrimp at 50 deg C, 20 minutes

Julienne ginger and scallions; heat oil to smoke point (200+ deg C), then pour over ginger / scallions resting on seafood

# 8. Stir-fried vegetables

### Ingredient 1: Bok Choy, hydroponic / LED

Cornerstalk Farm, Boston, MA
Uses LED lighting and hydroponics with recirculation, to grow all kinds of greens in shipping containers in East Boston
Future of urban farming, with low requirements for water and land; can be situated anywhere. Year-round availability
LED lighting drops power consumption, by allowing optimization of light colors that are used by plants to grow
(as opposed to broad-spectrum lighting, where most of the energy ends up as waste heat)

### Ingredient 2: Red bell peppers (Capsicum); seasonally available in late summer
