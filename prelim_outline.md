# 1. The Manhattan Problem: No "ethnic food" quite right

### Manhattan considered to have the "best" food in the world

Largely agreed that it has probably the widest variety of food from different cultures around the world. But is (any of) it really good?

### Everyone thinks "ethnic" food of other cultures is great, but own cuisine never quite right.

Nothing is considered authentic by the people who should know

+ The French love the Japanese food   
+ The Japanese love the Italian food
+ The Italians love the Chinese food
+ The Chinese love the French food

# 2. The Ratatouille effect: replication is authenticity

### People want an identical culinary experience to what they remember eating in the old country

Pixar's _Ratatouille_, when the harsh reviewer is taken back to his childhood by a single dish

### Things are considered "not right" if they deviate from that memory

Slight changes in flavor, texture, taste lead to judgment as "close but not quite there"

# 3. Transplanted cuisine: an example from Chinese food

### Most important transplanted cuisine today

Chinese diaspora fastest growing immigrant group in America, wealthier and more educated than average 

Half the world's population lives within a 4-hour flight of Hong Kong

### Food brought by people who immigrated from China

China is a country of 1.3 billion people, so it makes as much sense to talk of 
"Chinese" cuisine as it does of "white people" food. 

Heavy bias in particular regional cuisine, corresponding to waves of immigration

Chinatowns started by immigrants from Canton, later waves from different provinces

### Adaptation to local tastes for commercial reasons, in a restaurant setting

+ Cashew Chicken, Kansas City, 1970s

+ Ristorante Cinese, with traditional Italian serving structure of noodles first, then meat, with no parallels in actual Chinese cuisine

### Low cost trap limits quality

+ Not possible to have a fine-dining experience. 

+ No appetite for expensive Chinese food

+ Only acceptable fancy Asian food is Japanese ($400+ sushi in NYC). Why?

### Generalized problems are faced by other major cultures around the world

+ India also a very populous, large country with wealth

+ Next in population are Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh

+ Half of the world's population can't get a fancy meal based on their own food, in the West

# 4. Replication vs. local sourcing

### Is replication even physically possible? 

+ different ingredients
+ different climate

### Almost invariably, replication requires intercontinental transport

+ Unsound from an environmental perspective
+ Expensive
+ Quality always suffers from transport
