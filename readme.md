# The Manhattan Problem: No "ethnic food" quite right

### Manhattan is considered by its denizens to have the best food in the world

Largely agreed that it has probably the widest variety of food from different cultures around the world. But is (any of) it really good?

### Everyone thinks that the "ethnic" food of other cultures is great, 
but doesn't think their own cuisine is quite right.

Nothing is considered authentic by the people who should know

# The Ratatouille effect: replication is authenticity

### People want an identical culinary experience to what they remember eating in the old country

Pixar's "Ratatouille," when the harsh reviewer is taken back to his childhood by a single dish

### Things are considered "not right" if they deviate in flavor or texture from what they 
are accustomed

### Is replication impossible, physically, given different ingredients, climate, etc.?

# Replication vs. local sourcing

### Almost invariably, replication requires intercontinental transport

#### Unsound from an environmental perspective

#### Expensive

#### Quality always suffers from transport

# Transplanted cuisine: an example from Chinese food

China is a country of 1.3 billion people, so it makes as much sense to talk of 
"Chinese" cuisine as it does of "white people" food. 

### Food eaten by people who immigrated

#### Heavy bias in particular regional cuisine, corresponding to waves of immigration

Chinatowns started by immigrants from Canton, later waves from different provinces

### Adaptation to local tastes for commercial reasons, in running a restaurant

#### Cashew Chicken, Kansas City, 1970s

#### Ristorante Cinese, with traditional Italian serving structure of noodles first, then meat, with no parallels in actual Chinese cuisine
