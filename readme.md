# 1. The Manhattan Problem: No "ethnic food" quite right

### Manhattan considered to have the "best" food in the world

Largely agreed that it has probably the widest variety of food from different cultures around the world. But is (any of) it really good?

### Everyone thinks "ethnic" food of other cultures is great, but own cuisine never quite right.

Nothing is considered authentic by the people who should know

+ The French love the Japanese food   
+ The Japanese love the Italian food
+ The Italians love the Chinese food
+ The Chinese love the French food

# 1. The Ratatouille effect: replication is authenticity

### People want an identical culinary experience to what they remember eating in the old country

Pixar's "Ratatouille," when the harsh reviewer is taken back to his childhood by a single dish

### Things are considered "not right" if they deviate from that memory

Slight changes in flavor, texture, taste lead to judgment as "close but not quite there"

### Is replication even physically possible? 

+ different ingredients
+ different climate

# Replication vs. local sourcing

### Almost invariably, replication requires intercontinental transport

1. Unsound from an environmental perspective

2. Expensive

3. Quality always suffers from transport

# Transplanted cuisine: an example from Chinese food

China is a country of 1.3 billion people, so it makes as much sense to talk of 
"Chinese" cuisine as it does of "white people" food. 

### Food eaten by people who immigrated

#### Heavy bias in particular regional cuisine, corresponding to waves of immigration

Chinatowns started by immigrants from Canton, later waves from different provinces

### Adaptation to local tastes for commercial reasons, in running a restaurant

#### Cashew Chicken, Kansas City, 1970s

#### Ristorante Cinese, with traditional Italian serving structure of noodles first, then meat, with no parallels in actual Chinese cuisine
